LINUX COMMANDS:

1. `$ export "PS1=$ "`: This command changes the prompt format (the text displayed before you type a command) to a simple `$` symbol.

2. `$ pwd`: Prints the current working directory, showing you the full path of the directory you are currently in.

3. `$ mkdir rt`: Creates a new directory (folder) named "rt" in the current location.

4. `$ cd rt`: Changes the current working directory to the "rt" directory.

5. `$ touch yt.txt`: Creates an empty file named "yt.txt" in the current directory.

6. `$ ls`: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.

7. `$ nano yt.txt`: Attempts to open the text editor Nano to edit the "yt.txt" file, but Nano is not installed (hence the error).

8. `$ nano yt.txt`: Same as above, attempting to open Nano again.

9. `$ cd..`: There is a space missing between `cd` and `..`. It's trying to change to a directory named ".." but fails because of the incorrect syntax. The correct command is `$ cd ..`.

10. `$ touch mt.txt`: Creates an empty file named "mt.txt" in the current directory.

11. `$ mv mt.txt rt`: Moves (renames) the "mt.txt" file to the "rt" directory.

12. `$ cp rt/yt.txt`: Tries to copy the "yt.txt" file from the "rt" directory but misses the destination location, resulting in an error.

13. `$ cd rt`: Changes the current working directory to the "rt" directory.

14. `$ ls`: Lists the files and directories in the "rt" directory.

15. `$ cp rt/yt.txt 659cdd0923335/yt1.txt`: Tries to copy the "yt.txt" file from "rt" directory to a directory named "659cdd0923335" with a new name "yt1.txt". This fails because the source file is not found.

16. `$ cp yt.txt rt/yt1.txt`: Copies the "yt.txt" file from the current directory to the "rt" directory with a new name "yt1.txt".

17. `$ cd ..`: Moves up one directory level.

18. `$ ls rt`: Tries to list the contents of the "rt" directory but fails because the directory does not exist.

19. `$ ls`: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.

20. `$ cat yt1.txt mt.txt`: Tries to display the contents of "yt1.txt" and "mt.txt" files, but "mt.txt" doesn't exist, resulting in an error.

21. `$ touch mt.txt`: Creates an empty file named "mt.txt" in the current directory.

22. `$ cat yt.txt mt.txt`: Displays the contents of "yt.txt" and "mt.txt" files.
